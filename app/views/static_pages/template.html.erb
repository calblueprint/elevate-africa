    <p> Hi, I’m Charles. When I’m not busy saving the universe or rescuing cats from burning buildings, I’m a designer and programmer. I’m currently a back-end developer for UC Berkeley College of Engineering’s ResearchMatch internship platform. I’m also a designer for Berkeley’s Blue and Gold yearbook. I love racket sports, board game nights, jamming out on the guitar and piano, and playing video games. Bored? - Go on. Challenge me! </p>
